# Image-Editor
The modern world is awash in data, and photographs make up a large portion of that data. 

However, before these digital images can be used, they must be processedâ€”analyzed and altered in order to increase their quality or extract useful information. 

Due to its growing popularity as a scientific programming language and the free availability of numerous state-of-the-art image processing tools in its ecosystem, Python is a great choice for these types of image processing applications.

**The operations implemented are:**

* Histogram 
* computationHistogram 
* equalizationGamma 
* correctionLog 
* transformImage 
* negativeBlurring
* Sharpening
* Basic edge detection
